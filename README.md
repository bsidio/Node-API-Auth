#NodeJs Middleware for API Authorization

Built for a personal project which required api to be accessed by logged in users only.
This middleware assumes that the token is alread stored in cookie as
token="askjdansdkjansdasn".

The token is then verfied to check issuer. Only valid tokens are allowed to access the API
